# locUtil-subset
A set of utilities and methods for the localisation of n-dimensional MOs generated by the Hartree-Fock SCF, written for the PGI fortran subsystem.
Read the project PDF for more details on implementation and integration.

##### Note that these programs are NOT standalone, they expect a means of computing configuration 2-electron and 1-electron moment integrals for the system.

Debug routines expose greater flexibility in convergence for Edmiston-Reudenberg and Direct-Inversion in iterative subspace for near-localised gradient ascent.
