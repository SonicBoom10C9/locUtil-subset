# locUtil-subset
A set of utilities and methods for the localisation of n-dimensional MOs generated by the Hartree-Fock SCF, written for the PGI fortran subsystem.
Read the project PDF for more details on implementation and integration.

##### Note that these programs are NOT standalone, they expect a means of computing configuration 2-electron and 1-electron moment integrals for the system. Replace subroutine intglEval(aoL1, aoL2, aoR1, aoR2) with your own for computing this.

Debug routines expose greater flexibility in convergence for Edmiston-Reudenberg and Direct-Inversion in iterative subspace for near-localised gradient ascent.

##### Compile Notes:
1. Dependencies: Intel Math Kernel Library, LibBLAS, LAPACK
2. PGI fortran 18.10 or greater
3. OpenMP current spec (compiled with 5.0) is optional, uncomment sections in locUtilFns for parallelization support
4. FMA required, AVX optional
4. Expected of NxN Hermitian matrix form for SCF input, ASCII only for now.
